# So... a blog?

Well, yea. 

## Seriously...

Yup.

## But why? 

Good Question! I'm going to use this blog to write down some things that happen when working on projects, debugging stuff, thinking about concepts, solving problems and so on. Ill give my opinions here and share some stuff I learned. 

Now, I'm not a big writer, and I will never do this kind of stuff regulary. But I thought it would be nice to have some kind of archive of things I came across during development.

## And who are you? 

I'm Chris. A full stack software developer with focus on backend programming and huge interests in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
